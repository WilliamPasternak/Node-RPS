# Node RPS
This is the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with a slight twist. The user's opponent is the Node.js server!  This was the result of a paired programming session where our team was tasked with creating a simple application where the logic occured serverside. The first 'player' to 5 points wins!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS
A simple site was made using HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The user inputs Rock, Paper, or Scissors and sends their choice to the server. Node.js handles the computer's choice and randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors. It then compares the results on the server side and displays the results of the game in the DOM. A counter is updated and the first player to beat their opponent 5 times wins the game.

## Optimizations
Modernize functionality: I would update the user choice mechanism from being a text based input to pictures. This would allow it be played by non-English speakers. Allow the user to determine the number of games they are playing to. Currently it is set at 5. Include difficulties.

## Lessons Learned:
Working with a team was great. Contributors shared ideas to improve functionality. Splitting up the work allowed us to complete the task much more quickly and have a better project in the end. Technical lesson learned: Always double check that server refresh is enabled! There was a 'bug' that didn't acutally exist that was caused by updating a file and not restarting the server.
